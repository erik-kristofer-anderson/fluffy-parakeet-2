A website development project  

README  
This is a website to collect and display some of my hobbies.

I used the bootstrap starter template found here:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/starter-template/

I used the following components in the following places
1. Jumbotron - across each page
2. form - on the Music page
3. alerts - below the form on the music page
